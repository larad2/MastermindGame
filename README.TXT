PROJECT TITLE: 5 Digit number Guessing Game (Mastermind)
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this project is to create an interactive guessing game where the computer chooses a random 5 digit number and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program gives feedback using the words apple and orange to show how close the guess was to the secret number. This program helped me practice Java fundementals including loops, condititonals, user input, random number generation, and string/array processing.

This project is split into three main classes that work together:
Game manages all rounds, tracks information, and asks the user if they want to play again.
Round handles a single round of play, including generating the secret number, counting guesses, and checking for a win.
Guess provides helper methods to verify guesses and calculate how many apples and oranges should be displayed.
These classes interact to create a complete, multi-round guessing game.
VERSION or DATE: December 2025
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
1. Open the project in any Java supported environment.
2. Compile all classes
3. Run the Game class
4. Follow the on screen prompts to make guesses and play multiple rounds.
5. When finished, the program will display your statistics, including rounds won and average guesses per round.
